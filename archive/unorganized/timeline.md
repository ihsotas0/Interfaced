Chronology			Plot / History	Births and Deaths	Characters
Year	Date	Time			
1990-2010			CRT remained popular because I like the aesthetic of CRTs with crazy sci-fi tech. E-paper displays are used on tablets because it's cool. No other reasons.		
2020			COVID pandemic.	Edmund Bosak is born un-Interfaced and religous.	
2025			The Russo-Ukraine War ends with Russia maintaining Crimea while losing all other territory in Ukraine.	Lewis Rodney is born un-Interfaced.	
2026			Gaza is entirely ethnically cleansed to Sinai, excluding the 220,000 dead, however genocide trials for Israeli leadership will not commence until 2028.		
2028			Palestinian Genocide Trials and the beginning of accelerated Western decline.		
2030			For simplicity, computer miniaturization doesn't improve (Moore's Law) from this point on. Classical computers are 256 times as space, power, and temperature efficient as 2023. Production efficiency and cost plateaus. Computer software continues development and hardware specializes and innovates in other ways.		
2030			People began debating on whether or not AI is sentient.		
2031			Mammon is founded in Houston, soon to become the world’s leading plastics, chemicals, and materials manufacturer. The conglomerate will eventually grow to encompass other avenues over the next few decades.		
2039			The term 'proompt' is coined by the anti-sentience figurehead Harrison Arkwright.		
2040				Fayçal Beaumont is born un-Interfaced.	
2030-2050			Global famine, depression, and strife are common place; climate change results in mass migration from the global south, exaggerating negative Western sentiment. Stock and housing markets collapse. In cojunction with Western decline, WWIII is soon to come.		
2043-2046			World War III is largely a cyberwar between AIs. As the last fossil fuel reserves began to dry up, war became the only refuge of nations. The war ends largely as a stalemate between the West and East. Proposed and implemented during the end of the war, the MSEP (Massive Solar Energy Project) is intended to broker peace between all the nations involved in the war, now all incredibly destabilized.		
2046			Kernel City is formed in Sinai by millions of climate vagrants and war refugees seeking opportunity in cheap MSEP power. Many of the war refugees come from richer nations and have advanced technological skills. Societal progress slowed after the war, but Kernel City served as an important part of the rebuilding process.		
2047			KernBio, the sole proprietor of Interfaces, is founded in Kernel City, alongside the University of Kernel		
2048			The first fetus is Interfaced by KernBio.	Jordan Hayes is born Interfaced (first). Rafael Bosak is born un-Interfaced. Elliot Fetterman is born Interfaced and a double-signal	
2048			Tachiodyne, building off Interfacing, is founded in KC.		
2048			Verflux Studios, a Tachiodyne subsidiary, is founded in KC.		
2050			People begin development on the matrix, but don't succede until the Adam Task is found.	Rashid Al Haddad is born un-Interfaced.	
2052			The cryobed is invented by the newly formed Dark Ice Corporation in Russia.	Manoj Ramanathan is born Interfaced.	
2053			The first experimental medical Interfaced implants are installed on children in need.	Anita Signh is born Interfaced and a double-signal.	
2055			Interfacing becomes commonplace, ending most chronic illness and disability. Most nations adopt laws for compulsory installation. Religious and other exemptions become difficult to obtain. Fayçal becomes a pyschologist in Paris.		
2060			The MSEP is completed. Kernel City is now the de-facto economic and cultural center of the world, just as New York City was in 1960. With a completed MSEP, technological development accelerates in Kernel City.	Lewis' robot's digital-self is created.	
2062			The Adam Task repository, published by "ihsotas" in 2060, is discovered in the depths of the Internet. It allows for the creation of the matrix by way of easy connection parameter configuration. Interfaced teenagers, known as The Natives, created the foundation of the matrix in program space.		Fayçal Beaumont becomes a non-Interface psychologist in Paris, France.
2062			Research began on the Adam Task, although it will remain undeciphered. A program with the same level of perfection that the Adam Task achieves will never be created, and so the Adam Task will remain the only Matrix. Because of this, its seemingly arbitrary restrictions and rulesets dominate humanity leading to the Data War.		
2066			Tachiodyne's cybernetic eyes surpass organic vision after 18 years of frantic development anticipating the first Interfaced generation.		
2067			Corporate defectors create the ideas of Datism, arguing for an impartial and decentralized matrix (in the context of the Adam Task). Datism, in its early stages, is most similar to anarchism, but only applied to the matrix.		
2070			All crude oil is depleted, although most was gone by WWIII. Mammon makes plastics and other petroleum products with patented technology.		Fayçal Beaumont moves to Kernel City.
