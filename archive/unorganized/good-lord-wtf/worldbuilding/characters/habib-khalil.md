## Description

Rashid is a tall, Moroccan man of average build with a very short buzz cut and a
goatee. He is a simple and pragmatic man, wearing worn and beaten clothes and
sneakers out of a staunch refusal to buy clothing when he doesnâ€™t have to. The
one newer article of clothing he has is his watch. Rashid starts as a very
passive character approaching life with a certain neutral apathy and has one or
two children for whom he is an absent father figure. His best friend (who
suffers from schizophrenia) is someone he is more reliant on than the other way
around --- he balances his friend out while his friend livens him up. Rashid goes
from being passive and apathetic to cynical to an active character who takes to
heart that he can improve his life, but only if he tries.
