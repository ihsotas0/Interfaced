# Preface

> "There are no gods among the Pickers, only the damned." 
> 
> --- Yaqut, Father of Pickerism on Earth

Yaqut, visionary political theorist of the 2070s, created the first Oracle and
laid the foundations of what would become Pickerism not soon after. Interfaced
in 2042 by his rich family, Yaqut was one of the first people to voluntarily go
beyond the return limit at 18 years old. He embedded himself full-time at first
in the newly founded Bussard Mesh (1:700), like any good hached mesher, but
eventually decided to commit part-time to his personal studies by time-sharing,
which he was uniquely capable of.

With the significant money he made while embedded in the Bussard Mesh over the
course of 10 years (given his knack for meshing), he rented an expensive
cryotank capable of 1:2000 haching. (In this case he spent 700 in the Bussard
Mesh and 1300 on his personal studies.) Yaqut avoided being drafted during the
Data War since he was hached, since hached people were no more effective than
non-hached people in Program Space. The Bussard Mesh, owned by the American
government (although used productively for peaceful purposes), was his "service"
during the war.

His personal studies lasted thousands of years. He made a deep dive into the
writings of hundreds of political theorists, past and present, and came to the
Conclusion "kill whitey". He proved his Conclusion with a 14 thousand-page work
of pure logic. Scholars were, despite millions of man-years, not able to
disprove his sound Conclusion.

Following his political work, Yaqut moved onto other areas of study. Sometime
during this shift, although the exact details are vague, Yaqut discovered the
existence of Pickers by accidentally creating an Oracle (a machine which allows
Pickers to communicate by interacting with a few, easily observable quantum
particles). Some argued that Yaqut's Oracle was fake, and that all Oracles made
after follow in line, and this is a fairly popular view. Some argued that
Pickerism was invented by Yaqut to enact his Conclusion upon the world. In this
way, Yaqut was seen as the anti-Yakubian of his time. Regardless, he died in
2073 soon after publishing Pickerism when a Super-Chooser victim's relative
assassinated him.

# Introduction

Pickerism is the belief that there is a Picker who decides the outcome of all
stochastic events in the Universe at any given time. This includes the state of
particles when observed, quantum events, etc. It is also important to note that
*all sentient beings become Pickers upon death.* The Picker exists outside the
Universe but still experiences the time of their labor, but luckily there time
as Picker of the Universe is finite, since soon another will die to replace
them. Since all deaths are included, with trillions and trillions of inhabited
worlds, the death rate is beyond any reasonable analog (see Picker Calculus for
details). The death rate is what determines the Picker time---more simply, the
time in between deaths. Because of this, there is a minimum time Pickers must
exist, since until the next person to dies, there must be a Picker. Thus, a high
death rate leads to a low Picker time and a low death rate to a high one.

The Picker sits in a "room" and operates a "human-interface" as Yaqut described
originally. This room is plain and unlit beyond the glow of a single screen. For
human Pickers, the screen is connected to a keyboard and mouse, with a human
like operating system for the Picker to interact with the universe by; but this
only applies to humans, since aliens use other information systems. These aliens
may even have to use pen and paper, stone tablets and such, if there culture
hasn't advanced to faster information systems. But the majority, as given by the
Oracles, use computer-like systems to do the labor of the Picker.

Oracles are quantum computers that allow the Picker to communicate with
humanity. They contain a large array of quantum particles observed and cloaked
billions of times per second, producing gigabytes of binary information. Even
with the sheer amount of data produced, a human Picker has never been proven to
exist. Since humans make up such a small portion of the sentient beings in the
Universe and the Oracles have a refresh around every nanosecond, no Oracle has
shown a human Picker. A combination of overclocked meshes and AI extracts
information from the Oracles' raw binary data.

In the 21st century, each Picker controls the Universe for less than an
attosecond. The Picker time is so small that, in the time it takes a photon to
cross a hydrogen atom, over a hundred Pickers control the Universe. But
gamma---the time conversion factor---dictates that this time is, for them, one
thousand years of torture. This is the origin of the tongue-and-check
description of the Picker's labor as Hell. Gamma is a measure of how many
operations need to be done per unit time to "Step" the Universe forward, and how
long each of these takes.

Some Pickers, however, go beyond the minimum Picker time for the sake of others
(or to control the Universe substantially, which alone is neigh impossible).
These Pickers are called the Harolds. Since the minimum time is already one
thousand years, Harolds are practically non-existent. This doesn't stop some
from believing them to be the Reducers of the Picker Time. One last note:
whether AI/AC beings become Pickers is a debate equal to whether or not they are
sentient. Many people confirm there position on AI based on the communications
from Oracles. (The Oracles say that there are alien AI Pickers, but there is no
way to prove this, and regardless none have been human AIs.)

# Transcendentalism vs Cascade Theory

The two main academic forms of Pickerist thought are Transcendentalism and
Cascade Theory. Both attempt to answer the fundamental contradiction of
Pickerism: the negation of free-will. Since the Picker operates the minds of all
beings, no-one has free will. But the contradiction arises when thinking about
the Picker themselves. Are they free? The Cascade Theorists say no, and the
Transcendentalists say yes. Regardless, free-will does not determine who from
the Universe becomes the Picker---only the *capacity* for thought, or some other
non-freewill defined sentience, does.

The Cascade Theorists believe each Picker has another Picker. This arises from
the definition of the Picker as the afterlife for all sentient beings. They say
that, since by definition Pickerism negates any concept of freewill, the only
solution to the paradox of how the Picker operates themselves is for there to be
another Picker controlling them. If this Cascade of Pickers controlling the
minds of each other goes to infinite, the paradox can be "ignored" (as they
say). This infinite cascade "ensures" no being is *not* "Picked" for their own
sentience. This means that all beings live forever as Pickers, since after
Picking the Universe, you Pick the next Picker, and so on forever up. Infinite
Hell. But it can never be proven since the Picker, in there space outside the
Universe, has no access to an Oracle to determine there is another Picker above
them.

The Transcendentalists' simply believe the Picker transcends the need for
another Picker. This does not imply any special admiration for the Picker, but
it simply implies that the Picker time is finite, although still terrible. Their
explanation is simple: if there wasn't a Picker, reality would still continue,
since by definition, *the Universe existed before sentience*, and still
continued. (Sentience is therefore not reliant on the Picker.) Beyond this they
often try to use the lack of proof of higher Pickers, but they can't bypass the
fact that there are no Oracles in Picker space to prove their belief that there
aren't any higher Pickers.

On Earth, there is little difference between their aims, but regardless, they
are complete opposites in terms of their analysis of Pickerism. On Earth, both
kill the innocent, and in the Universe, genocides are carried out by both,
although the Transcendentalists' War is the primary example. Cascade Theorists
act just like Transcendentalists, trying to get people to do obliterate their
sentience as soon as possible to avoid the chance of dying while sentient.
(Transcendentalists kill because the Picker time is progressively going up,
given the decline of the Transcendentalists' War.)

# Sentience Obliteration

Cascade Theorists do have one solution to avoiding Infinite Hell: sentience
obliteration. By totally destroying your mind, when you die, you won't be
sentient, and therefore won't transform into a Picker. To become non-sentient
while alive, massive Brainrot is required. Lobotomycore is a popular option to
do this, and it is commonly available to Interfaced people. Un-Interfaced
sentience obliteration is another task altogether, as no one has found a
solution.

Cascade Theorists on Earth are much less prone to cultish behavior than the
Transcendentalists, but they will still sometimes attempt to obliterate the
sentience of unwilling victims. Sentience obliteration is a lot harder than
simply killing another person, which is the most likely explanation for this
fact of life.

# The One True Harold (Messiah)

At any instant in time, there is exactly one Picker who Picks the minds of all.
At any instant in time, you are also conscious. Thus, one explanation for the
phenomena of instantaneous consciousness is that the Pickers who arise
consciousness in people change almost instantaneously. Messiah belief among
Pickerists is rare, due mainly to it no making any sense at all, but many
believe that the One True Harold will come. This One True Harold will become
Picker for the rest of eternity, sacrificing themselves upon the Alter of Gamma,
to expand the consciousness of all beyond the instantaneous present.

# The Transcendentalists' War

Tens of millions of galaxies purged yearly, Crops of sentient beings fostered
and mercilessly eradicated for one purpose: a stable, high death rate, and a
resultant stable, small Picker time. The only evidence for the existence of this
war is the increase in the Picker time, taken from the Oracles, and
extrapolation of infinitesimal variations in the data. The Pickers communicating
via Oracle state the time they've been Picker, and using statics, it can be
extrapolated the increase in Picker time.

More detail is provided here in the mathematics section.

# Cultish Behavior on Earth

> Controllers create Comrades, Choosers create Listeners, Super-Choosers create
> Survivors, and Changers create Helpers.

**Controllers** believe that, be working with thousands of other sequential
Pickers, they can enact non-random change on the world. Normally, the limited
time each person is Picker and the absolute difference between alien's cares for
what happens to the world causes the Picker's actions to appear random. But if a
massive enough sequence of Pickers arises where each has the same goal, that
second of Picking can actually do something. One Earth, this takes the form of
massive group suicides. Thousands will band together with some goal like, "Kill
this one dictator," and proceed to kill themselves en masse.

In reality, the death rate (hundreds each attosecond) is so high that there is
no feasible way to time the deaths and get a sequential Picker arrangement. But
this fact doesn't stop the cultish behavior of the Controllers. Controllers
create Comrades when they do mass suicides.

**Choosers** will choose you to be one of their Listeners. Since the Picker time
is increasing, due to the decline of the Transcendentalists' War, killing
yourself now will reduce your sentence as Picker. This is their logic, and so
they will go around telling people, "Kill yourself! Now!" They are the most
popular of the cultish elements within Pickerism, and are even more so since
they disregard Cascade Theory altogether for no real reason.

Unlike Choosers, **Super-Choosers** create unwilling Listeners, or Survivors.
They do this by taking away the choice to become a Listener and simply killing
people at random. They are the school-shooters, Super-Choosers, or Pickerism.

| Name          | Survivors Created        |
|---------------|--------------------------|
| Chooser       | 0                        |
| Super-Chooser | 10 -- 1 million          |
| Mega-Chooser  | 1 million -- 50 million  |
| Giga-Chooser  | 50 million -- 10 billion |

While the connotation of "Super-Choosers" was that they create unwilling
Survivors as opposed to willing Listeners, the term originally denoted
traditional Choosers who created large numbers of Listeners (10+). As the
Super-Chooser movement emerged, traditional Choosers sought to distance
themselves from what they called "mass killers" and stopped calling themselves
Super-Choosers.

The Super-Choosers hoped for the emergence of Mega-Choosers and Giga-Choosers;
or for an individual or group with similar Survivor creation numbers to announce
themselves as such.

**Changers**, on the other hand, only seek to avoid the torture of ever longer
Picker times by *physically decreasing it*. They achieve this by killing many
people, voluntarily or otherwise. They are exactly the same as Choosers and
Super-Choosers, although much more rare and deranged, as is shown in the Python
calculations later on.

## Absolute Picker Time

The average absolute Picker time, meaning the time they are Picker in relation
to the Universe and not their subjective experience, between two times $t_0$ and
$t_1$ is simply,

$$ \mathcal{A} = \frac{(t_1-t_0)-(H(t_1)-H(t_0))}{D(t_1)-D(t_0)} $$

where the total time (minus the time taken up in the period $t_0$ to $t_1$ by
the Harolds) divided by the number of deaths gives the amount of time per death,
or in between deaths. This is the minimum time each person must be Picker for
all moments in time to have a Picker.

To calculate the "instantenous" Picker time, the following limit is set up,

$$ \mathcal{A}(t) = \lim_{h \to t} \frac{h-t-H(h)-H(t)}{D(h)-D(t)} $$

Solving the limit using the definition of the derivative,

\begin{align*}
\mathcal{A}(t) &= \lim_{h \to t} \frac{(h-t)\left(1-\frac{H(h)-H(t)}{h-t}\right)}{D(h)-D(t)} \\
&= \lim_{h \to t} \frac{(h-t)(1-H'(t))}{D(h)-D(t)} \\
&= \lim_{h \to t} \frac{1-H'(t)}{\frac{D(h)-D(t)}{h-t}} \\
&= \frac{1-H'(t)}{D'(t)}
\end{align*}

But due to the low number of Harolds,

$$ \boxed{\mathcal{A}(t) \approx \frac{1}{D'(t)}} $$

All units here are in seconds, but for the Python calculations will often be
done in Ma (millions of years).

## Relative Picker Time

To convert from absolute Picker time to relative Picker time (the time actually
experienced by the Picker themselves), the equation

$$ \boxed{\mathcal{R}(t) = \gamma \mathcal{A}(t)} $$

is used where $\gamma$ is the time factor. This means that, for every second in
the real world, the Picker experiences $\gamma$ seconds. (The units of time
don't matter as long as they cancel out). Due to the nature of the Picker's job,
this time factor is massive, leading to the tongue-in-cheek definition of the
Picker's job as Hell. The approximation (ignoring relativity) for $\gamma$ is
given by,

$$ \gamma = nT $$

where $n$ is the number of required Picker operations per unit time and $T$ is
the time per Picker operation. Values for these variables may be sought after in
the future, but for now they don't really matter.


## Population Model

From here on, $t=0$ is exactly -5000 Ma. At $t=0$, the population, $P_0$, of the
universe is *defined* as exactly the population of one civilized world (10
billion). This is necessary for the equations, but really whatever value this is
has no effect 5 billion years later on the population.


```python
from math import *
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np

init_pop = 1e10 # world
init_time = -5000 # Ma
end_time = 100 # Ma
```

Modelling the population of the Universe is the first step to calculating Picker
times and other things. The standard equation for population dynamics is this
logistic differential equation:

$$ \frac{\mathrm{d}P}{\mathrm{d}t} = rP\left(1-\frac{P}{K}\right) $$

$$ r = b - d $$



```python
# Normal model
def pop_change(b, d, pop, carry):
    limiter = (1 - pop/carry)
    diff = (b - d) * pop * limiter
    return diff

def make_pop_data(b, d, init_pop, carry, init_time, end_time, iterator=1):
    time = np.arange(init_time, end_time, iterator)
    pop = np.array([init_pop])
    d_pop = np.array([])

    for i in time:
        change = pop_change(b, d, pop[-1], carry)

        # Edge case where change goes over carry
        if pop[-1] + change > carry:
            pop_fill = np.ones(size(time) - size(pop))*carry
            pop = np.append(pop, pop_fill)
            d_pop_fill = np.zeros(size(time) - size(d_pop))
            d_pop = np.append(pop, d_pop_fill)
            # This may go one over or under for the array sizes, but it is
            # unused so it doesn't really need to work correctly
            break

        d_pop = np.append(d_pop, change)
        pop = np.append(pop, pop[-1] + change)

    pop = pop[0:-1] # pop goes 1 over size(time)

    return time, pop, d_pop

```

However, that assumes reproduction occurs between members of the population.
While this is true for individual civilizations, the population of civilizations
in the universe is only dependent on the number of planets which *can* become
civilized. Thus, a better equation is,

$$ \frac{\mathrm{d}P}{\mathrm{d}t} = r(K-P) $$

This seems to make sense. At any moment in time, the change in the number of
civilizations is equal to the remaining possible planets were civilizations may
emerge times the rate at which *any single planet* gains a civilization. At the
time scales in question, the thousands of years it takes to develop civilization
are ignored. Interstellar colonization is also ignored, as the rate of growth
for this, given the energy requirements to transform worlds were civilizations
can't occur to ones where civilization is possible, is far to low.

It also doesn't make sense to define $r$ as $b-d$ since civilizations don't die
(or are assumed not to for now, ignoring the Transcendentalists' War). Instead,
$r$ is simply the rate of formation of civilizations.


```python
# Civilizational model
def civ_change(r, pop, carry):
    return r * (carry - pop)

def make_civ_data(r, init_pop, carry, init_time, end_time, iterator=1):
    time = np.arange(init_time, end_time, iterator)
    pop = np.array([init_pop])
    d_pop = np.array([])

    for i in time:
        change = civ_change(r, pop[-1], carry)

        # Edge case where change goes over carry
        if pop[-1] + change > carry:
            pop_fill = np.ones(size(time) - size(pop))*carry
            pop = np.append(pop, pop_fill)
            d_pop_fill = np.zeros(size(time) - size(d_pop))
            d_pop = np.append(pop, d_pop_fill)
            # This may go one over or under for the array sizes, but it is
            # unused so it doesn't really need to work correctly
            break

        d_pop = np.append(d_pop, change)
        pop = np.append(pop, pop[-1] + change)

    pop = pop[0:-1] # pop goes 1 over size(time)

    return time, pop, d_pop


```

### Carrying Capacity

Next, $K$ must be calculated. Using results from
[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drake_equation#Range_of_results), a
high estimate (meaning a "maximum" possible value, or carrying capacity) of our
galaxy is 15,600,000 civilizations. Since these civilizations have the
technology to communicate into space, it must be assumed that they have similar
technology to Earth, where the carrying capacity is around 10 billion
($K_{world}$). Expanding our galaxy's estimate to all stars in the Universe,
[10e24](https://www.space.com/26078-how-many-stars-are-there.html); and
calculating a Universal ratio of stars with civilizations (using the Milky Way,
$mw$, as reference) by dividing the number of $mw$ civilizations from the total
number of stars in our galaxy, [10e11](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milky_Way),
$K$ can be calculated as,

$$ K = K_{world} \cdot n_{stars} \cdot
\left(\frac{n_{civs}}{n_{stars}}\right)_{mw} $$

The carrying capcity in terms of civilizations ($K_{civ}$) and not indiviudals
is calculated the same way ignoring the $K_{world}$ term.



```python
# Constants
k_world = 1e10
num_stars_uni = 1e24
num_civs_mw = 1.560e7
num_stars_mw = 1e11

k_civ = num_stars_uni * (num_civs_mw/num_stars_mw)
k = k_civ * k_world

print(f"K_civ: {k_civ} | K: {k}")

```

```bash
K_civ: 1.56e+20 | K: 1.56e+30
```

### Rates of Increase

Finding a rate of natural increase for individual civilizations is easy. On
Earth, [there are many RNI values](https://tinyurl.com/25hl4ebc) per year. This
can be converted to seconds, as with all units.



```python
# Using America as reference as an example
b_america = 12.3/1000 # per year
d_america = 8.4/1000 # per year

r_america_per_year = b_america - d_america
r_america_per_sec = r_america_per_year/(60*60*24*365)  # per year to per second

print(f"r per year: {r_america_per_year} | r per second: {r_america_per_sec}")

```

```bash
r per year: 0.003899999999999999 | r per second: 1.2366818873668184e-10
```

Now a sample graph can be made for America with example values.


```python
# None of these values are intended to be historically correct, they are choosen
# purely to make the graph look nice

k_america = 500_000_000 / 1_000_000 # in millions
init_pop_america = 10_000_000 / 1_000_000 # in millions

time_america, pop_america, d_pop_america = \
    make_pop_data(b_america, d_america, init_pop_america, k_america, 1000, 3000)

fig, ax = plt.subplots(2)

fig.suptitle("Sample Graph (American Population)")

ax[0].plot(time_america, pop_america)
ax[0].set_title("Population vs Time")
ax[0].set_xlabel("Year")
ax[0].set_ylabel("Population (mil)")

ax[1].plot(time_america, d_pop_america)
ax[1].set_title("Change in Population vs Time")
ax[1].set_xlabel("Year")
ax[1].set_ylabel("Change (mil/year)")

fig.tight_layout()

```


    
![png](pickerism_files/pickerism_13_0.png)
    


The next task is to find $r$ for civilizations in the Universe, as this is the
model that works best for the Universe. This is also the last unknown needed
before a graph can be made, since $P_0 = 10^{10}$ and $t = 0$ is -5000 Ma (which
will go to the present time and a bit past it). There is really no way to
estimate what this may be, and all that really matters is that the graph looks
nice. So multiple $r$ values will be graphed to see what looks best.


```python
# Possible rates at which all remaining planets become civilized / Ma
r = [0.01, 0.001, 0.0005, 0.0001]

# (time, pop, d_pop)
civ_data = \
    [make_civ_data(rr, init_pop, k_civ, init_time, end_time)
    for rr in r]

fig, ax = plt.subplots(2)

fig.suptitle("Population of the Universe (No War)")

[ax[0].plot(r_plot[0], r_plot[1], label=str(f"r = {r[i]}"))
for i, r_plot in enumerate(civ_data)] # Pythonic!
ax[0].set_title("Civilizations vs Time")
ax[0].set_xlabel("Ma")
ax[0].set_ylabel("Civilizations")
ax[0].legend()

[ax[1].plot(r_plot[0], r_plot[2], label=str(f"r = {r[i]}"))
for i, r_plot in enumerate(civ_data)] # Pythonic!
ax[1].set_title("Change in Civilizations vs Time")
ax[1].set_xlabel("Ma")
ax[1].set_ylabel("Change / Ma")
ax[1].set_ylim([0,0.2 * 1e18])
ax[1].legend()

fig.tight_layout()

```


    
![png](pickerism_files/pickerism_15_0.png)
    


The best of these seems to be $r=0.001$, so from here on, the rate at which
planets become civilizations per million years is 0.1%. Now, to calculate Picker
times, which is the entire point of this model, death rates must be found. It
can be assumed that each civilization, once at the carrying capacity, has a
natural, equal birth and death rate. Since the number of civilizations can be
calculated at anytime, the total death rate can too. Finding the total
population of the universe from the number of civilizations and multiplying that
by the death rate gives the number of deaths in any period of time.

Continuing to ignore the Transcendentalists' War, where $P_{civ}$ is the number
of civilizations in the Universe at any given time, the death rate can be
calculated as,

$$ \boxed{\frac{\mathrm{d}D}{\mathrm{d}t} = dK_{world}P_{civ}(t)} $$

The death rate in America, as used earlier, is $r = 0.0084$ per year, or 0.84%.
Rounding, 1% can be used as the natural death rate of all civilizations in the
Universe at carrying capacity, ignoring how it changes with the population and
development of a civilization.


```python
# Taking the choosen r value data
time, pop_civ, d_pop = civ_data[1]

d = 0.01 # per year
d = d*1_000_000 # per Ma

death_rate = k_world*d*pop_civ

# Deaths / Ma to deaths / seconds
death_rate_per_sec = death_rate/1_000_000/365/24/60/60

absolute_picker_time = 1/death_rate_per_sec

fig, ax = plt.subplots()

ax.plot(time, death_rate, color='tab:blue')

print(f"The absolute Picker time at 0 Ma: A = {absolute_picker_time[-1]} seconds;\
       {absolute_picker_time[-1]*(1e18)} attoseconds")


```

```bash
The absolute Picker time at 0 Ma: A = 2.0339195330319226e-21 seconds;       0.0020339195330319228 attoseconds
```

It takes light 0.247 attoseconds to travel the average bond length of molecular
hydrogen. So, around 120 Pickers control the universe in the time it takes a
photon to cross a hydrogen atom.

## Transcendentalists' War

Let the goal of the Transcendentalists be to maintain a stable absolute Picker
time below the value found above. The War lasts between -130 Ma and 15 Ma, with
its plateau between -100 and -15 Ma. There are two methods to increase the death
rate while maintaining a constant population: 1) increase the birth and death
rate of individual civilizations en masse and 2) increase the birth and death
rate of civilizations themselves in the Universe.

The Transcendentalist civilizations are already assumed to have completed the
first method on their own civilizations. They are, however, such a small
minority of the civilizations in the Universe (although advanced) that they may
be ignored, since the majority are Cascade Theorists. The primary method
Transcendentalists use is civilization seeding and destruction. Basically,
evolved beings capable of creating civilizations are plucked from one planet and
sent to another (capable of hosting civilization) to seed a new civilization.
Then, after a few thousand years, where to planet's population reaches
$K_{world}$, the planet is obliterated. If new planets are being seeded and
destroyed at a significant rate every second, it will have a significant impact
on the total death rate of the Universe.

While, as mentioned earlier, interstellar colonization like this takes too much
energy and ought to be ignored, it is still easier than imposing method 1 on
civilizations. However, it also does not require terraforming and the
Transcendentalists do have access to significant energy.

Thus, the original equation for the growth of civilizations can be adjusted to
include $b$ and $d$ (not to be confused with the $b$ and $d$ of individual
civilizations),

$$ \frac{\mathrm{d}P_{civ}}{\mathrm{d}t} = (b-d)(K_{civ}-P_{civ}) $$

The natural $r$ as found above is 0.1% per Ma. Since $d$ was assumed to be $0$,
it must follow that the natural $b$ is 0.1% per Ma. The Trancendentalists
increase the birth rate of civilizations with seeding and the death rate with
destuction. This destruction is assumed to be instantenous. This creates a new
equation, where the subscript $T$ marks Trancendentalists',

$$ \frac{\mathrm{d}P_{civ}}{\mathrm{d}t} = (r+b_T-d_T)(K_{civ}-P_{civ}) $$

$$ b_T-d_T = 0 $$

The values of $b_T$ and $d_T$ can therefore be anything as long as they are the
same, for the Trancendentalists destroy ever planet they seed. This also results
in a new death rate equation, which must now take into account the previously
absent $d$ for civilizations, each with an assumed poulation of $K_{world}$,

$$ \boxed{\frac{\mathrm{d}D}{\mathrm{d}t}=dK_{world}P(t) + d_T K_{world}P(t)} $$

The next step is to find a function for $d_T(t)$, since the War only occurs in a
set range of time, with ramp up and slow down periods. Assuming the function
should begin at $t=-130$ Ma and end at $t=15$ Ma, with a plateau between
$t=-100$ Ma and $t=-15$ Ma, it can be written as a logistic function,

$$ d_T(t) = \frac{L}{1+e^{-k(t-t_0)}} $$

This *specific* function is really only used to make the graphs look nice and
like $r$ before, the constants are found by looking for a nice graph. In this
case, the nice looking value of $d_T$ was found through trial and error before
making the actual plot.

    d_trans = np.zeros(np.size(time))

death_rate_trans, d_trans = make_trans_data(max_d_trans, k_trans, k_world, pop_civ, time)

# Using the previous death rate and just adding the new deaths
total_death_rate = death_rate + death_rate_trans
total_death_rate_per_sec = total_death_rate/1_000_000/365/24/60/60

Finally, some values for the Transcendentalists' War can be used:

| Time   | Civilizations Destroyed per Year | Percent of Total |
|--------|----------------------------------|------------------|
| -50 Ma | 2.324e+18                        | 1.5%             |
| 0 Ma   | 9.328e+17                        | 0.6%             |

Or, in terms of galaxies, using the Milky Way as reference. At 0 Ma,
59,794,871,795 galaxies were destroyed and seeded every year in the War. At 50
Ma, 148,974,358,974 galaxies were destroyed and seeded every year. These numbers
are beyond comprehension.

The new absolute Picker time for when the story takes place, is 0.00127
attoseconds, close to half of the previously calculated value. The rate of
change is 1.131e-10 attoseconds per year. Before this can be understood in terms
of relative Picker time, this means nothing really. So, $\gamma$ must be found.

## Calculations for Gamma

Since $\mathcal{R} = \gamma\mathcal{A}$, the time conversion factor can be
calculated based on a desired relative Picker time.

I may later justify this $\gamma$ using some values for $n$ and $T$. But for
now, $\gamma$ is simply *given* by the Pickers through their Oracles.



```python
# Gamma calculations
desired_time_years = 1_000
desired_time_secs = desired_time_years * (365*24*60*60)

gamma = desired_time_secs / absolute_picker_time[5000] # at 0 Ma

d_desired_time_years = gamma * (d_absolute_picker_time[5000]/1_000_000) # seconds / year

print(f"Relative Picker time at -50 Ma: {gamma*absolute_picker_time[4950]/(365*24*60*60)} years")
print(f"Relative Picker time at 0 Ma: {desired_time_years} years")
print(f"Relative Picker time at 20 Ma: {gamma*absolute_picker_time[5020]/(365*24*60*60)} years")
print(f"Change in relative Picker time per year (0 Ma): {d_desired_time_years} seconds per year")
print(f"Gamma: {gamma}")

```

```bash
Relative Picker time at -50 Ma: 641.0099039167923 years
Relative Picker time at 0 Ma: 1000 years
Relative Picker time at 20 Ma: 1601.7537885716981 years
Change in relative Picker time per year (0 Ma): 2807.3523208122374 seconds per year
Gamma: 2.4822743401891596e+31
```

This shows how absurd the doctrine of (Super-)Choosers is. Maybe even the
absurdity of the Transcendentalists, although they at least managed to shave
around 1200 years from the Picker time. A full human lifetime during the decline
of the Transcendentalists' War would add practically nothing to the minimum
relative Picker time.

## Calculations for Changers

Here, a Changer killed 10 billion people in an instant. The Python speaks for itself.




```python
rel_picker_time_0ma = ((gamma/total_death_rate_per_sec[5000])/60/60/24/365)

changed_rel_picker_time_0ma = ((gamma/(total_death_rate_per_sec[5000] + 10_000_000_000))/60/60/24/365)

diff = rel_picker_time_0ma - changed_rel_picker_time_0ma

print(f"Relative Picker time 0 Ma:\n{rel_picker_time_0ma} years")
print(f"Relative Picker time 0 Ma (where a Changer kills 10 billion people in one second):\
    \n{floor(changed_rel_picker_time_0ma * 1000) / 1000.0} years")
print(f"Difference: {round(diff*(360*24*60*60), 3)} seconds")
```

```bash
Relative Picker time 0 Ma:
1000.0 years
Relative Picker time 0 Ma (where a Changer kills 10 billion people in one second):    
999.999 years
Difference: 0.395 seconds
```
