# Meshing

Meshing is a process where signals are meshed together. This means each unit
host handles now the computations of a larger signal as a component part. Thus,
no component knows the process of the larger mesh, leading to secure compute.
Neurons mesh to neurons, overlapping minds together while only increasing the
abstract density of the neurons in the one meshed mind. Meshing is intended to
be an alternative to traditional artificial intelligence by utilizing a more
efficient system of pre-existing organic neural networks.

## Time-sharing

Meshers can time-share on meshes were with lower clock-speeds than their
clock-speed. For every unit time, there brain's capacity, much like
double-signals, is split between the mesh and some other activity. This is a
very difficult thing to do, and must Meshers instead clock to match existing
meshes, do work, and then leave and change clock-speed for other things.
