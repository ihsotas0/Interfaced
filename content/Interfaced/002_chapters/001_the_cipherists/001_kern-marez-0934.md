# The Cipherists

The server room Elliot Fetterman overlooked was red-hot, the dry air perturbed
by the heat, no light other than the glow of near molten radiators. The entire
computing array was sunken down into the ground, slightly; his view of it
obscured by the reinforced metal framing of a thick acrylic window, tilted
overlooking the expanse. Each node flickered, and the whole valley of computers
faded into the dark fog of the background.

Elliot scrunched his leg up on the windowsill as he swung the other back and
forth. In his ear, or, more accurately, his head, the Interface that ran up and
down his entire nervous system played music. However, unapparent to his primate
monkey brain, it was not "music," nor was it even noise. It was the *effect* he
wanted, the one he selected using synth-intuition. Nothing more was needed to
clear his mind, although there was definitely more his Interface had to offer.

He watched the computers silently do their work. Underground and protected from
strife, the single square kilometer server was forgotten. In fact, it was
unlikely that anyone other than the *Cipherists* had seen it in decades. The
five *Cipherists* resided in a small utility room with a two-step concrete floor
leading upwards to the window. A magnificent crack penetrated through the corner
of the room, leading to the server, where dozens of thick and thin, mute colored
cables came out.

"Elliot," Manoj asked. He laid unconscious, elongated by his thin frame, in a
cushioned reclining chair. His arm was plugged in from his wrist to a *portable*
neural modem, which weighs over one hundred pounds. It was about the size of
mini-fridge. The tens of unorganized wires protruding from his wrist resembled
red muscle fibers. Elliot is unfazed.

"Elliot..." Elliot's neural modem, on the other hand, was slightly smaller and
substantially thinner than a milk carton. It fit in his backpack and connected
to him wirelessly via spine mounted implant. Manoj didn't have wireless
implants. He didn't need them. He spent every day in the Matrix, unlike Elliot.
But that was simply the reality of the situation --- more specifically, it was
what the situation demanded of him.

"Elliot---" The cables which came from the festering computers split haphazardly
to three people: Manoj, Anita, and Elliot. Even the wireless modems got a taste
of this speed (although nowhere was the latency more than one hundred
milliseconds, thanks to advances in Internet infrastructure: the backbone of the
Matrix). It was the best possible connection to the Matrix, but soon Elliot
would be forced back on the wireless network.

"Elliot!" The layered sounds of the utterance came to Elliot in delayed steps,
one after the other, forming an alien, persistent thought in his mind, echoing
its serious tone. Manoj's peer-to-peer connection with Elliot, not routed
through the Matrix, was janky since it couldn't utilize Adam Task protocols.

"Fuck you! What!"

Manoj messaged what would be a rightward nod, if he were in front of Elliot, to
Elliot over the same peer-to-peer connection. Some primitive reflex in Elliot's
mind was enough to understand this synthetic, non-verbal, unreal communication.
The connection was facilitated directly by the neural modems, so it makes sense
that anything emulating the genius of the Adam Task's Signals --- like this
protocol --- would be so nebulous and unintuitive. But it made up for this, in
the eyes of many, *because* it didn't connect to the Matrix.

Elliot looked to his right. Provisions littered the place, now long consumed and
discarded in the small room. Manoj was nodding to where Rafael and Habib (the
last two *Cipherists*) seemed to be arguing. The room was strewn with pleasant,
soft LEDs. But beyond that there were only a plastic few chairs and a table,
excluding Manoj's throne. Anita sat uncomfortably upright, unconscious, by
Manoj, in one of them. Elliot slid his boot off the cool concrete and let it
hang by his other before hopping down onto the floor.
