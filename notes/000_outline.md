## Chapter 1: The Cipherists

**Scene 1:** Elliot Fetterman overlooks an underground Adam Task dedicated server
(kern-marez-0934). Manoj interrupts him over a non-Matrix peer-to-peer
communication link to look at the other two boys arguing, and to notify him that
it's time to start the operation. Rafael and Habib argue if Elliot Fetterman
plays online games with pain on or off. He leaves the guessing as they walk out
the maintenance tunnels to a manhole cover and exit to start their operation.

**Scene 2:** Elliot, Rafael, and Habib walk around the roads of suburban Kernel with
backpacks carrying all of their gear. Manoj, revealed to be at a small overclock
of 1:4 using Merc, guides them to an old hydrogen car which Habib unlocks with a
small hacking tablet. The three steal the car and begin driving to the city
center at Olana. It is revealed that they are being sent to assassinate Felix
Vue, and that they have been underground for no reason other than to sightsee.
Manoj, who is in the Matrix with the anonymous client in a crypt-room, instructs
them that the operation has begun before returning to overwatch.
