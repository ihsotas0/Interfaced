# Inspiration

1. *Necromancer* --- Evil AI, cyberpunk, etc. Nothing unique to mention.
2. *Snow Crash* --- I found this book difficult to read, maybe because of my college
   work, but also because it had very *big* prose.
3. Ten Days That Shock the World.
4. *Disco Elysium* --- Italics
5. *Cyberpunk 2077* ---
6. *Tau Zero* --- Specifically my favorite scene in the book. One of my favorite
   scenes in general. The scene where the workers do an EVA to fix the engines
   of the ship while traveling near the speed of light. The surrounding space is
   silent and black. The motion of the ship is unapparent. They are alone in the
   Universe.
7. *Three Body Problem* (trilogy) ---
8. *All Quite on the Western Front* (book and 2022 movie) --- The book
9. *JoJo's Bizzare Adventure* ---
10. *Chainsaw Man*
11. *Severance*
