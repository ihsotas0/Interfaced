# Hosts and Signals

*Also explained here: host detachment, the Cipher.*

The topic of hosts and signals, in relation to *Interfaced*, is one of, if not
the most, complicated part of the story's world. Most simply, the "host" is the
intelligence or sentience of a being, whether artificially conscience (AC) or
human. The "signal" is the organ of processing, not performing, the interaction
with the world, whether reality, the Matrix, or other spaces. Humans
intrinsically have both an organic host and an organic signal.
