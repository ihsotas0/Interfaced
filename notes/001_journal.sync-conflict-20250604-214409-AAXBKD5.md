Digitized handwritten notes from February 2025:

- The Traveler forces host detachment on non-willing humans to inhabit their
  bodies as minions. This is very inefficient though, as the softorgans used by
  normal AC's, which the Traveler uses, are limited in their reaction time and
  understanding of the human body. This is because softorgans are *general* and
  normal humans' hosts are *specific* to their organic signal.
- Relationship diagram for characters (circle common relations and label them).
- Theme: humanity vs the individual. The Traveler is at the far end on the side
  of humanity, believing the individuals to be no more than cells. Next is
  Elliot, who disregards his own selfishness, disinterest in people, and
  uninvolved actions as a consequence of him being a humanity being nothing more
  than cells. At the other end is Monique--Faycal, who sees a unique beauty to
  the individual that transcends humanity; where humanity is a flimsy construct
  made by individuals' unique beauties, terrible or great, that seek to craft
  society.
- Socialism is the best system to improve the material conditions of humanity as
  a whole and maximizes the prevention of the terrible individuals from crafting
  society (through the accumulation of capital, the most concrete method of
  crafting society). Since humanity is a flimsy construct, it cannot hope to
  prevent terrible unique beauties from rising more than to put in place a
  systematic barrier (socialism).
- Socialism is objectively true. What remains is what it means to be human.
- The question of humanity vs the individual is not some argument between
  socialism and individualism or any other liberal, immaterial nonsense; it is
  the question of what, if anything, is beyond the material world.
- Character named *Sodium*.
- Signal traces; signal translation done by Cipher to match unpaired hosts and
  signals (two layers of signals to encode and decode).
- Lobotomycore defeats the Data Eater (Traveler) in the end as the Cipherists
  deceive the Data Eater into giving them it for sentient obliteration, for
  their fake Pickerist beliefs. It is rerouted back to kill the Traveler by
  Elliot.
- *The Modern Authoritarians.*
- Clamping spider-like neural modem on back, or elsewhere, which tortures victim
  through wireless connection or wrist-jack using *Pure Pain*. Are neural modems
  used for non-Matrix Interface stuff like implants?
- Superpronouns and computational gender.
- Insulted by being called heterosexual.
- Rule-of-cool: Aleks fights for final two seconds in real world (a few minutes
  in Matrix) as bullet is fired at his head. Rule-of-good-characters: Aleks
  overclocks with Merc too fast to fight better and save others. Has heart
  attack but continues to fight for fifty seconds in real world (minutes in
  Matrix) until he dies.
- Bullets fired at multiple overclocked characters heads, minutes in Matrix but
  no possibility of being able to react in time to avoid the bullets if they
  disconnect immediately.
- Bullets fired at one character than another. Every minute wasted fighting in
  Matrix kills another person until they can defeat the (double-signal?) shooter
  over the Matrix.

Life is that which uses energy to avoid reaching equilibrium with the universe.

Fire uses energy to reach equilibrium, to remove the energy with no goal of
avoiding equilibrium for the maximum time possible. Cancer is not life, for the
same reason. **Humans are not life, for the same reason.**

Aesthetics, a new Method?

Methods are innate to Signals, which arise from Hosts. While it is the nature of
the power of the Signal which determines the Method, without an Interface, the
beauty of one's Method can never be found. Nature vs Nurture.

Using multiple bifurcations, mind-states running in parallel, to distribute the
harm to the mind while fighting in the Matrix. Clock-speed it limited, but less
of the mind dies if one Signal gets terminated.

Saccade.

**FUCK THE DATA WAR.** It's holding me back and serves no purpose for the story.
The Cipher still gets invented, but not to stop some *grand* war.

Shit from Featherflight:

- The Not: beyond even program space is the domain of the empty mind. It isn't.
- Add Winchell Chung
- Joke for Cobalt Saber: The only things still left in space are spy satellites
  and a couple ludicrously expensive hotels with no more than a few rooms each.
  All this technology on Earth, but the rich determined the absurdity of
  "profiting" from asteroid mining and other ventures, so they never developed
  space beyond their own personal pleasures. There is no McGuffinite for the
  rich to go after, so it will stay this way until they have their own personal,
  and not profitable (because "profitability" in space is simply absurd),
  ambitions in space.
  - "After 50 years, the first man is back in space. It's a billionaire!"

Manoj's Method: Insufferable lag

Elliot's Method: Connect Userland like a web

The Signal is the sensory and physical manipulation section of the brain,
simulated by the Matrix, created by the Adam Task. It is unique to each
individual Host. Some individuals have *unusual* Hosts, leading to the formation
of Methods, which are unique implementations of the Signal function which grant
the user special powers.

These powers match the user's personality for two reasons:

1. *Narrative.* If the personality matches the power, then when the character
   uses their power, their personality can be elaborated upon and their usage
   can be used to highlight more about there character.
2. *Worldbuilding.* The Signals are a reflection of the user's mind on the
   Matrix and thus "share" the same personality. Because of these, the
   aberration in a normal Signal caused by unusual people match their
   personality through the Signal.

Method: Keeps Signals at set distance from each other.

*Shared dreams.* Before even the most basic Matrix protocols, the only
**mental-world (find better word)** that existed was the dreamworld. So early
Interface pioneers connected dreams into one.
