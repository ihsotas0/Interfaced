* Thought: Juxtaposition of Palestine genocide and "Trump not laughing".
* "Seeing how AI is better than 99% of people really shows the importance of the
  remaining 1%" is nonsense.
* Check out MIT liquid neural nets.
* The Traveler ends with this: "You idiots, do the revolution! It's so simple!
  All the other 'aliens' have, so why not you? You are entirely unique in many
  ways, but so are all the others. Your languages and music, their logical
  structure compaction and improved conscience objectivity."
* Foodpak.
* "Hacking bomb" AI mini computer, like digital pathogens (not computer malware,
  since they are physical).
* Graph database of everything.
* Black Mirror Interface "social media".
* Onion black boxes/communities.
* Sitting in a lecture hall, and for half a second, all the necks snap
  backwards.

No-one not directly employed at the company --- and its single factory --- had
every seen anything beyond the end-product, itself delivered in a similar manner
to special, highly-secure stores. Attacking the end-product or the retail stores
was limited in scale compared to attacking the source, which is why Dylan went
out of his way with this hack.

* "Rice" computers are "common-place". A nuisance.

Infects the rice supplier of the factory -> rice left in trash, plates, floors,
and in people's guts -> mainly from rice in people's guts, they act as a mesh
network on extremely low power to avoid detection and attempt to hack the
factory.

Food standards became more stringent after the incident, but the original
creators of the Rice Hack never thought to create a more general payload to
infect entire food supply-chains (although such a thing is likely impossible,
since the payload is limited in its generality).

*Pickerism* is a religous belief which emerged around the same time as
h-clocking. The primary deity is the Picker, who nebulously changes over time.
Each Picker controls the universe for a set time, relative to their original
reference frame (i.e. home planet). All sentient beings become Pickers upon
death; it is what Pickerists believe the afterlife is. The time selected for
each Picker is based on the order of death --- that is, who died last. The
Picker then acts as "god", controlling the outcome of all random quantum events.
They "sit in a room" with an "interface" custom made for their species and
culture to do this. Ever quantum event is then presented in order. Once all the
events for a "Universal Step" (which varies based on relativity) are complete,
they are executed. The number of Steps each Picker completes is only known to
the High Priest, who is in direct communication with the current Picker at all
times.

Sects have formed within Pickerism as to how the Picker is sentient without
having their own Picker. Some believe the quantum events driving the Picker is
determined by another, lesser Picker (the Late-Diers). Others believe that the
sentience of a Picker transcends the need for their own Picker. Prior to the
emergence of sentience, the Pickers were simply the first future sentient beings
who died, transported back in time. This, alongside the Transcendentals, leads
to ritual suicide.

Kill self to become Picker in era of sentience instead of heat death. Therefore
suicide is holy.

A man, *Yaqut*, who spent thousands of years h-clocked reading political theory
and related literature, including current events, came to this simply
conclusion: "Kill whitey."

The Cybernetic Model is a manifold which is the nearly perfect approximation
function for creating other accurate manifolds for certain cases. It perfectly
tunes other models, but, at the same time, it's manifold --- which is already
perfect within its set --- is expanded to include a unique "person" which arises
from the entropy of the stochastic combination of all the other models of the
artificial consciousness (AC).

Unified Theory of Intelligence is ***DIFFERENT*** from Unified Theory of
Everything! (Pickerism?)

The rate of double-signals among the population is inversely proportional to the
generations of Interfaces. Double-signals are dying out. This is because the
density of pins increases with better technology. Double-signals arise from the
disjunction --- by the Adam Task --- between the signal (the computed neural
network) and host (the organic neural network). When the disjunction is high,
the separation between the two becomes apparent to the host. But when the pin
concentration is high, the disjunction approaches zero and the chance and one
host is a double-signal decreases.

Hached signals' models are different from normal peoples' signal models: they
operate at a different speed from the host. This is why, alongside the
biomechanical reasons, return limits exist. If your signal is faster than your
host, there is no hope for a successful reunification of host in signal. Hached
people are practically severed signals.
