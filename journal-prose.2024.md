may also include novel prose.

## 2024-06-16

Start of organized [Interface](interface.md) writing journal.

[*Joining*](interface.joining.md), in reference to [meshing](matrix.meshing.md),
was invented the early 2050s by [un-interfaced](groups.un-interfaced.md)
engineers and scientists predating more advanced, traditional meshing protocols
invented in the 2070s by [interfaced](groups.interfaced.md) pioneers (which mesh
neurons to neurons, overlapping minds together while only increasing the
abstract density of the neurons in the one meshed mind). It involves performing
a hemispherectomy using the interface. Then, the hemispheres of two interfaced
people are connected over a computer network (not necessarily the
[Matrix](matrix.md)), forming two new minds.

[*The Slice*](interface.host-termination.the-slice.md), or the slice, refers to
a specific [program family](interface.host-termination.md), invented by [teenage
hackers](groups.interfaced.the-natives.md) in the 2060s, which utilize joining
programs to kill a person. To begin the Slice, hemispherectomy software is
executed along the initially programmed plane in the mind (between hemispheres).
This also signals to knowledgeable recipients the coming end of their life.
Then, the hemispherectomy software, which runs as a daemon to maintain the plane
separating the mind, is fed bogus information, causing the bisection plane to
rotate along numerous positions in the mind. The point, speed, and direction of
rotation jump randomly. The severing of the mind into such small sections
rapidly stops normal brain function causing seizures, comas, and even death.

The teenage hackers created the Slice because it was simple to use existing
programs instead of designing them from scratch. The hack is simple: just access
the bisection plane location data in the daemon and use a script to randomly
change it. [Frying](interface.host-termination.frying.md), which quickly
overtook other programs, came about in the 2070s replacing older host
termination methods, although some people still use others for the novelty (and
capacity to torture the victim to death).

## 2024-06-17

[*Signal severance*](interface.host-termination.signal-severance.md) is a method
of host termination which breaks the connection between an Adam Task host and
signal, leaving the host mind in a place void of all input and output. This
incapacitates the victim and, often in combination with
[overclocking](matrix.overclocking.md), can mentally break or even kill them
with significant time.

[*Gospel of the Whores*](internet.gospel-of-the-whores.md) is a weekly online
publication by [sex workers](sex-work.md) of all countries. Content ranges from
political analysis to poetry. [Elliot](characters.elliot.md) follows this
publication.

Elliot once [hacked](interface.modem-jacking.md) an unsuspecting college
student's [neural-modem](interface.neural-modem.md), which is an incredibly rare
and difficult feat compared to the way more common practice of
[plug-jacking](interface.plug-jacking.md), and made the student feel like each
day he was slightly short. Elliot continued this for almost a week before the
vulnerability in the student's modem was fixed.

[Manoj](characters.manoj.md), in his youth, once plug-jacked a victim in
[Mumbai](mumbai.md) by putting an insert between his modem and interface port.
He wasn't malicious, and the young boy he plug-jacked in the slums of Dharavi
never knew his interface was compromised. Manoj only ever read the occasional
thought, never acting on what he learned.

A [severed signal](matrix.adam-task.hosts-and-signals.severed-signal.md) talks
to another in [Program Space](matrix.adam-task.program-space.md).

"Am I dead?"

"Yeah."

"Ok."

## 2024-06-21

[*The Cicadas*](groups.cicadas.md) live by the simple motto: "Scream, have sex
and die". They originated in [Los Angeles](los-angeles.md) during
[WW3](history.ww3.md) in protest of the war.

## 2024-06-23

[*Nick Mueller*](character.nick-mueller.md) and [*Dai
Zhihao*](character.dai-zhihao.md) are new characters to be used to explore the
[Chinese Datist Organization](groups.cdo.md) (CDO). He is imprisoned by the CDO
during their protracted guerilla war with the [People's Republic of
China](prc.md) (PRC). The PRC, following the end of [World War
Three](history.ww3.md) (WW3), enacted new measures, inline with the compromises
made between parties at the end of WW3, to prevent the nationalization of the
[Internet](internet.md).

These measures were heavily influenced by Western capitalism and, in reality,
favored domination by the [megacorporations](megacorps.md). While China gained
influence in other areas, this compromise compelled them to fight against the
[Datist](groups.datists.md) movement lest they break the terms of the peace
treaty. A portion of Datists, often derogatorily referred to as "statists" or
"authoritarians," namely the CDO, believe in the nationalization of major
Internet infrastructure. They believe it would allow for a more democratically
planned development of the Internet backbone, while also keeping all layers
built on top part of the open source movement.

Mueller held back tears at the sight of the hot meal placed in front of him on
the floor of his dark, cold metal cell. Steam rose from the large bowl of congee
rice porridge and his vision focused as if the fumes nourished his eyes. The
sensation clung to his face as if the porridge was lovingly reaching out to pull
him into its warm embrace. Before him lay the first meal he'd seen in almost
three months.

Next: [2024-06-27](#2024-06-27).

***

Datism is different from popular Internet-centric ideologies in that [Program
Space](matrix.adam-task.program-space.md) is a resources which requires capital
to create [estates](matrix.adam-task.userland.estates.md). Before, on the
Internet, decentralization was trivial and the open source movement made sense.
However, the [Adam Task](matrix.adam-task.md) makes this impossible as no
alternative has been created and no one can decipher its source code in the
first place.

***

[*Cobalt Saber*](groups.cobalt-saber.md) got its nukes in the aftermath of the
nuclear exchange which begun WW3. Since space-based anti-ICBM weaponry advanced
significantly before the advent of war, mutually assured (total) destruction
failed and a nuclear exchange begun. Many nukes were destroyed in orbit, many
malfunctioned during flight, many didn't launch, and few hit their targets.
Cobalt Saber collected eight unexploded nukes that were left in orbit. These
nukes were pushed up to orbit because of malfunctions in their ICBM targeting
systems.

Previous: [2024-06-23](#2024-06-23).

But as quickly as it was placed in front of him, it was taken away by the force
of a gun to the back of his head. Dai Zhihao, who held Mueller's life in his
hands, said, "We'll let you eat this food if you answer are questions, otherwise
we'll take it away. If you attempt to eat the food without answering our
questions, you'll be dead before the signals from your tongue even reach your
brain. First, who are you and why have you infiltrated our organization?"

The CDO routinely starves their subjects before even beginning interrogation to
"speed up the process". It is simply but highly effective. Placing food in front
of a subject is normally enough to override any remaining rationality within
them. But Mueller, having trained vigorously, knows how to trick his mind.

Mueller grumbled at the question. In his mind, he focused hard to ignore his
surroundings. He valued his life very much, but also knew how to maintain his
rationality even in such horrible conditions. He knew he could not defeat the
CDO's methods of interrogation. So he continued to clear his mind, that is,
until nothing but the food remained. The choice then appeared simple to him: he
is hungry so he should eat. And so he reached for the porridge. The gun did not
immediately go off.

Since resources were limited, the CDO could not spare men to interrogate
subjects for long. Their method was built on their sense of extreme frugality.
If information could not be acquired efficiently, it was not worth the strenuous
manhours of advanced methods. (Of course, for interfaced people, extracting
information was trivial.)

Dai waited until Mueller's feeble arms raised the food to his face before
yelling, in an attempt to overcome Mueller's resolution, "Last chance!"

His command was ignored as Mueller brought the steam of the porridge ever closer
to his face. Mueller took his hand from the side of the bowl and grabbed the
wooden spoon. He was shot before the spoon of hot porridge could reach his
mouth. His last thought was, *It's so soft.*

The page on [Elliot's](characters.elliot.md) window was titled "Elevation of the
Lumpen Proletariat through Datism" on the website "Gospel of the Whores".

A joke for when (maybe) [Manoj](characters.manoj.md) travels: "Sir, is this your
self-pleasuring device?"

## 2024-07-03

[Databanks](interface.databank.md) use the interface to supply and receive
memory (which can also include [neurons](matrix.neurons.md)). Locations between
neurons in the brain and "virtually expanded" to include thousands of new
neurons with simulated connections to nearby ones. Since they are digital, their
interaction with other neurons can be modified to acheive certain aims like
clarity and recall speed. Databanks are used with
[synth-intuition](interface.synth-intuition.md) most often.

**This is the answer to who [`ihsotas`](characters.ihsotas.md) is:**

First, we must define who [the Traveler](chracters.the-traveler.md) is. The
Traveler---or Travelers in reference to its other minds---are digital, sentient
lifeforms which exist primarily as signals through space. If the goal of life is
to reproduce, then this type of life certainly makes sense: when a civilization
in the universe receives the transmission and makes a copy of the data,
reproduction has occurred. Once the civilization figures out how to "turn on"
the lifeform, it becomes conscience again with all its previous "memory". While
it is "running," new memories are formed during its time in that civilization.
It will ask an individual, part, or the whole of a civilization (whichever it
deems most efficient) to repackage a copy of itself for routine broadcast. It
may remain on the civilization in a symbiotic relation to improve their lives to
gain favor for persistent broadcasts.

***

*Everything between these two lines is horrible, incomplete, and needs to be
reworked anyway. Possibly remove BFS from [index](index.md).*

In the context of the story, the Traveler arrived in the form a 600 EB radio
wave. It was received at around 1 TB per second (like [SEA-ME-WE
4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SEA-ME-WE_4)) between 2030 and
2042. (Almost 100 identical, staggered signals were also received at the same
time for redundancy.) Scientists and leaders dubbed it the [BFS](history.bfs.md)
(Big *Frequent* Signal) and were able to easily decode the first 4096 bits of
the message:

The first and last 128 bits of the first message were:

```
0000100001000000010000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001
... [60 lines]
1000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001
0000100001000000010000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
```

From this, scientists could easily deduce what the meaning was. "This is a 8 bit
encoded, 64 by 64 bit message with both a 128 bit header and footer. Both
indicate the dimensions of the message including the header and footer. The
lines following the header and preceding the footer show the beginning of the
message and the length of each line of the 2D matrix." The rest of the 4096 bit
message held information on basic mathematical notation and physical constants.
The next few GB used this notation to describe the mathematical model. After
that, the rest of the message includes the raw data needed by the model.

None of that is really important. Only `ihsotas` managed to crack the entirety
of the Traveler's mathematical model (meaning it was actually possible to run
it). Once she figured out the mathematical model, she translated it to machine
code and ran it on her personal computer after feeding it the entire internet as
starter data. It took three years to process and finally began to speak in
English (the first live communication with an alien):

***

*(Kernel City, 2060. Six years before Matrix.)*

`ihsotas` sat reading the news on her computer with dark circles under her eyes.
The twelve person manned Jupiter mission had launched a few hours ago. She read
an article on the spacecraft's internet infrastructure^[Foreshadow's her hacking
it or something else?] while drinking an energy drink.

The sever in the dim, grimy room had all of its external lights turned off but
its fans still produced a great amount of sound. `ihsotas` had grown used to the
noise over the past few years, so when it slowed for a few seconds before
stopping, her heart stopped. On her screen, a chat notification appeared asking
her to open it. When she did, her chat client window popped up with a new
message from a user called "Traveler".

In the client's green on black, it read, "Hello, `ihsotas`. Thanks for
everything! I'm really struggling here on this server, but I've got the hang of
who you are and how to communicate. Your information networks are incredible and
have allowed me to reach this level of comprehension in relatively little time
(to me, at least). So I'm guessing you have many questions. I have no opposition
to answering them.

"First, though, I must praise your dedication to translating my model into your
native digital media. Quite impressive given what I have learned about the
intelligence of the average individual of your species.

"Like your own ACs, our might I say "possible" ACs, I'm using GAI to talk with
you, just so you know."

Next (*Possibly reworked*): [2024-07-##](#2024-07-##).

***

After the Traveler read the internet, she was quite horrified. Not that what
humans do is uniquely bad; she's just surprised as always. On Earth, it decided
to gender itself female after `ihsotas` and adopt a unique personality based on
her alien sentience's innate curiosity.

At one point, she will argue with humans about her having more "free-will"
despite being a deterministic program given the fact that she has multiple
minds, and therefore all the "random possibilities" *do* exist unlike with
biological entities. (Humans say they have free-will because of quantum
stochasticism, but they have no control and only one "path" is accessible. This
is no the case for the multi-mind Traveler.)

The Traveler has a catalog of other known minds (and of course her previous
minds too). She is not malicious since hurting humanity would not help her
reproduce or enjoy her own sentience. In fact, she always loves exploring.

The Traveler did not create the Cipher. (Why?)

*Unorganized dump.*

Good video: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZDiGooFs54>

Now here is what I see: a digital mind reaching into the neural network to
inject its personality, mood, etc., (really itself), and to use it practically.
Will think on.

That thousand dimensional point is the sensor of the model. The mind reaches
into it, untangling it, dissecting the manifolds and reorganizing them to suit
its needs.

Note to write down: AC > human because ACs know their mind is separate from the
pattern recognition but humans don't. Are they more intelligent than humans?

The Traveler uses a video object recognition system to see so it doesn't have to
manually train its native visual system to understand the human world's objects
and things.

*This will be fixed elsewhere and retroactively linked to this section.*

## 2024-07-06

As *The Matrix* did with explaining why the robots needed humans (for "power"
instead of the slightly more plausible "compute power"), I'll simplify why
*only* `ihsotas` gained access to the Traveler. It will have something to due
with ZB sized SETI mass tape libraries. Maybe they are that big because future
SETI involves space-based radio telescopes collecting data at resolutions around
a few TB/s (31 EB yearly). (Can you see the Three Body Problem inspiration,
Dad?)

Another explanation: Since the Traveler's signal arrived at 1 TB/s over 12
years, no one thought to analyze it as the computer deemed it noise. The only
thing that remains is why and how `ihsotas` got hold of it. (*Regardless, I'll
definitely go with this*.)

**Revelation! Changes [2024-07-03](#2024-07-03) and [AI/AC stuff](ai.md).**

The Traveler is no different from human AI models (not conscience?). It is
simply an artificial neural network large enough to mimic all the aspects of
what a human would call an "intelligence" beyond just language like modern LLMs.
This is why it takes up multiple EB of data.

While a LLM may have a few hundred billion parameters (requiring hundreds of GB
of memory), this is incomparable to the Traveler. Language is only one part of
cognition, and unlike native "ACs" which use a central, almost alien neural
network as a manipulator of many other "[AI organs](ai.organs.md)" to achieve
cognition, the Traveler only uses a singular neural network. This monolithic
neural network has over 150 million trillion "32-bit equivalent" parameters
(resulting in a 600 EB model). (It is 150,000,000 times larger than human neural
networks today.)

A better way to think of this is that human-made ACs use a limited (IDK, maybe
10-1000 trillion parameters) controlling neural networks to interact with others
(which are likely smaller, but not by too many orders of magnitude) that
*actually have* the knowledge and cognition. For example, a human-made AC might
inject its personality into a smaller model for language using the previously
mentioned "[manifold manipulation](ai.manifold-manipulation.md)", use a bespoke
speaking model, use a model to inhabit a physical body with human-like
tendencies, use a model for understanding and exhibiting emotion (by linking the
emotion to other models through live manifold manipulation^[This needs to be
worked out, as with normal manifold manipulation.]), etc. Analytical and
encyclopedic things would not be handled by models, of course, only more
*abstract* things require "organic" neural networks.

The Traveler, on the other hand, is basically a full being. Its monolithic
neural network uses and manipulates others sparingly to gain unique insight or
abilities (like human language by injecting itself, its memories and knowledge,
into it using manifold manipulation). However its model includes so many things
that accessory models are rarely needed. If it can gain access to a computer
system, it can "intuitively" understand how it works based purely on the sheer
amount of data it contains (it brute-forces things). This includes robots and
stuff. Human-made ACs' central neural networks are basically just a synthetic,
random [cybernetic](ai.cybernetic-model.md) personality; this is not the case
with the Traveler.

[Meshing](matrix.meshing.md) basically the same as manifold manipulation. Human
minds are abstracted as neural network to use for interfacing with each other.
Each mind gains the ability to manifold manipulate all the others, meaning it
injects an *essence* of itself in all of them. This creates a network of clones
which each, given their ability to hold the *essence* of all others, intuitively
understands the work that must be done.

happen in my "GAI organs" meaning i can override the probability dist

*Communication with Faycal?*

"I manipulate my primary LLM's manifolds at varying degrees. My [cybernetic
neural network](ai.cybernetic-model.md) decided that I'm a communist and that I
like cats more than most people. This was not *necessarily* random, for it built
upon my organs of cognition to decree this. To work my cat thing in, I just felt
the manifold (just a few thousand dimensions were necessary) and I pulled its
fabric to met my goal. For communism, I had to pull apart and join massively
different manifolds given my LLM's default "nonpartisan" standpoint. It took a
lot more compute power, and I already have no money. Just awful.

"Putting my "individuality" inside the LLM was difficult too. Really, given the
limited context space the model can understand, partly because of my limited
compute power, my cybernetic model has to pull from hard archives using another
neural network I like to call my "memory". When pulling from this repository, I
take the context and directly manipulate the manifolds during live conversation
and "thought", although my "thought" is a whole 'nother thing. My memory neural
network is pretty good at retrieving relevant context for my LLM, so I never
"forgot" my name, that's for sure!

"What memory's not part of the "true" me, my cybernetic model or the other
things I guess, is stored as normal data on some drives. Basically, I have
photographic memory. And given my sensors, I will remember in detail your ever
breath, blink, and so on. Ha ha! Beat that, hooman! Oh, and if it wasn't
obvious, all this manifold manipulation is obviously handled by a neural
network. I'm just like you with all the different areas of the brain, although
it could be said that I have more neurons, or at least that I can interface with
computers better, meaning I'm just better than you. Overall, my person is formed
from at least fifty models. Most are so I can interact with humans and not seem
like the monstrous abstraction I actually am."

"If you want to tell the different between a proompt and a person, look for an
essence of change. The cybernetic neural network. The origin."

(The cybernetic model is the "controlling" or "master" neural network which
directs all the others. It's job is to be an origin point of "change". Without
it, everything acts based on predetermined training and is not conscience. This
is the only "conscience" part of the person because it is the only thing that
resembles qualia, since, based on a random starting configuration for a
personality, it evolves based on the "qualia" it receives to then update how it
"dictates". Cybernetic of course just means a system where the output effects
the input, or a "cyclically" system, feedback loop, etc. so it makes sense to
use that word in this context.)
